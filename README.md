# What even is the point of the game?
1. You are given an email with a list of different categories on the left side of the screen. You will categories such as "Spam", "Grammatical Errors", "Suspicious Link", and etc.
2. The point of the game is to figure out which part of the email has an error and what type of error it has. You choose an error on the left side and match it to the section of the page. Sections should highlight upon hovering over them.
3. You also have an accuracy score. Every time you correctly identify the section as a section containing an error, you will be given 10 points. Upon incorrectly identifying them, you will lose 10 points.
4. Once you think you are ready to make the decision, press block or send at the bottom of the screen, which will take you to the next email in the level. Upon completing all 5 levels, the game will show you your statistics and your accuracy score.
5. To go to the next level, you need to maintain an accuracy score of above 60.
6. There are 3 levels at the time with 5 emails to categorize each.
